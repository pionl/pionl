<h1 align="center">👋 I'm Martin</h1>

> I write mainly PHP code in Laravel with main focus on strict types and DDD.

My second focus is on iOS / NodeJS / writing tools and packages that are used in my/clients projects. 

- 🚀 **Currently working on**: [azzurro.cz](https://www.azzurro.cz), [Movapp.cz Apple app](https://github.com/cesko-digital/movapp-apple), [LaraStrict - Strict Laravel](https://larastrict.com), [PHP SDK builder](https://github.com/wrk-flow/php-api-sdk-builder)

- 💬 Ask me about **Laravel & PHP**

- 📫 How to reach me **martin@kluska.cz** if you want to help me or support me.

- ⚡ Fun fact **I wish I had more time, I have a lot stuff that are not published yet!**

- ⛑ I need help with documentation in my packages 👍

- 🚀 When I can, I'm on the mission to make life easier for us developers - thats why I started [Wrk-flow](https://github.com/wrk-flow) with tools I've created in past years (still not everything is up 😅 ).
