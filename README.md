In short, I make stuff ðŸš€

At this moment my main focus is:

- I develop in type strict and safe PHP (from 2008)
- I use Laravel with my opiniated extension and conventions called [larastrict.com](https://larastrict.com)
- I can write iOS/Mac apps (started 2012)
- I can write NodeJS apps in Javascript / Typescript

**Currently working on**: 

- [azzurro.cz](https://www.azzurro.cz)
- [Movapp.cz Apple app](https://github.com/cesko-digital/movapp-apple)
- [LaraStrict - Strict Laravel](https://larastrict.com)
- [PHP SDK builder](https://github.com/wrk-flow/php-api-sdk-builder)

What I'm looking for from Open Source? Well, from the start I like to share my solutions to share my ideas :)
